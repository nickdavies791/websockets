#Laravel Websockets
A simple websockets example. 

A user creates a new post and the post is instantly shown to any other logged in users without the need for refresh.

This example uses [beyondcode/laravel-websockets](https://github.com/beyondcode/laravel-websockets) as a Pusher replacement, [laravel-echo](https://www.npmjs.com/package/laravel-echo) to listen for events broadcast by the application and [Vue.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vue) to display the content on the front-end.
